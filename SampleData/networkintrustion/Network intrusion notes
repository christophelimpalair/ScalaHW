Network intrusion
Some exploit behaviors follow known patterns
The biggest threat maybe one that has never been detected and classified (zero day attack)
Part of detecting potential network intrusions is detecting anomalies. There are connections that aren't known to be attacks, but not resemble connection that have been observed in the past. 
Unsupervised learning techniques like k-means can be used to detect anomolous network connections. (Doesn't necessarily mean it is intrusions)

k-means can cluster connections based on statistics about each of them. Clusters can define regions of normal connections and known attacks.
Everything else outside is unusual and potentially anomolous.


1) the algorithm picks some data points as the initial cluster centroids.
2) each datapoints is assigned to the nearest centroid
3) for each cluster, a new cluster centroid is computed as the mean of the data points just assigned to that cluster.

This process will repeat until certain iterations or all points are stabalized

The organizers had already processed your network packet chain into summary information about individual network connections.

Each row is one collection. For each collection, the dataset contains information like the number of bytes sent, login attempts,
TCP errors. Each collection is one line of CSV -- formatted data, containing 38 features.
A label is given in the last field. Most connections are labelled normal but some have been identified as examples of vaious types of network attacks. (23 types of attacks)
